# CFRBCS Model: Advancing E-commerce Recommendations 💻

## Combining Clustering and Sentiment Analysis for Personalized Product Suggestions

Welcome to the repository where I develop and train the **CFRBCS Model** – a hybrid recommendation system that leverages **Sentiment Analysis** and **Product Clustering** to offer personalized product suggestions.

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

The **CFRBCS Model** aims to enhance the accuracy and relevance of e-commerce recommendation systems by combining two powerful techniques: **clustering** and **sentiment analysis**. This hybrid model improves product recommendations by understanding customer sentiment and clustering products based on key factors like price and popularity.

---

## 🎯 **Objectives**
1. **Analyze user sentiment** to identify customer preferences.
2. **Cluster products** by price and popularity for more tailored recommendations.
3. **Validate the performance** of this newly developed hybrid model.

---

## 🛠 **Methodology**
This project follows a multistage approach to develop the hybrid recommendation model:
- **Dataset**: [Sephora Products and Skincare Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nadyinky/sephora-products-and-skincare-reviews)
  
  ### Stages:
  1. **Product Cluster Analysis** using pricing and popularity factors.
  2. **Comprehensive Similarity Score Calculations** based on user ratings, sentiments and product popularity.
  3. **Recommendation Score Prediction** to suggest products that align with customer preferences.

## 🧠 **Why This Research is Important**

- 72% of consumers prefer personalized recommendations while shopping online. 
- 75% of business executives believe personalization is crucial for digital experiences.
  
The **CFRBCS Model** addresses a research gap by integrating sentiment analysis and product clustering—an approach that enhances personalization like never before. 🔍

---

## 📊 **Results, Significance, and Impact**
- Identified **5 distinct product clusters**, each based on price and popularity, offering unique insights into customer preferences.
- The model outperforms traditional recommendation systems, excelling in key evaluation metrics like **RMSE**, **MAPE**, **MAE**, and **MSLE**.
- **Better prediction accuracy** leads to deeper insights into customer preferences and more effective product recommendations.
  
Future work includes integrating advanced clustering techniques like **DB-SCAN** and exploring deep learning models for even more refined sentiment analysis. 🚀
